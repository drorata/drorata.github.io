First of all I am a learner --- I like to learn.

I obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics from the [Freie Universität Berlin](http://www.fu-berlin.de) under the supervision of G. Rote for the [Theoretical Computer Science Work Group](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ti).
During my doctoral studies I was a member of the [Berlin Mathematical School](http://www.math-berlin.de).
Currently I work in the data science field.

## Contact Surfaces visualization

<iframe width="400" height="255" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SBFwgR4K1Gk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>

This video visualizes the contact surfaces in the configuration space of a triangular robot which translates and rotates amid planar polygons.
It illustrates the various possible contacts and their three-dimensional representation.
The visualization is based on an explicit parameterization of the contact surfaces.

The video was presented at [SoCG 2012](http://socg2012.web.unc.edu/"), Chapel Hill, on June 20th 2012.
