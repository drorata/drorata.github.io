### Contact Surfaces visualization

<iframe width="400" height="255" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SBFwgR4K1Gk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>

This video visualizes the contact surfaces in the configuration space of a triangular robot which translates and rotates amid planar polygons.
It illustrates the various possible contacts and their three-dimensional representation.
The visualization is based on an explicit parameterization of the contact surfaces.

The video was presented at [SoCG 2012](http://socg2012.web.unc.edu/"), Chapel Hill, on June 20th 2012.
