- My supervisor was G. Rote from the [Theoretical Computer Science Work Group](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ti/index.html)
- During my doctoral studies I was a member of the [Berlin Mathematical School](http://www.math-berlin.de) and I also contributed to [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org)

### Contact Surfaces visualization

Here's one of the highlights of my academic past:

This video visualizes the contact surfaces in the configuration space of a triangular robot which translates and rotates amid planar polygons.
It illustrates the various possible contacts and their three-dimensional representation.
The visualization is based on an explicit parameterization of the contact surfaces.

The video was presented at [SoCG 2012](http://socg2012.web.unc.edu/"), Chapel Hill, on June 20th 2012.
