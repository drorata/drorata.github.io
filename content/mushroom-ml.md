Summary: Playing around with decision trees on a dataset of mushrooms

## Preface

I have posted a notebook on GitHub where I explore a dataset of mushrooms.
This dataset together with simple decision trees lets you decide whether a mushroom is poisonous or not.
Still, using this model in real life is on your own risk!

The initial version of the [Notebook](https://github.com/drorata/mushrooms-ml/blob/fe36adc90f78b32dc2b9cbfadf5d9516ca090986/Summary.ipynb) is "pasted" here.
Note that there might be changes and updates to the notebook, which you can check directly in the [repository](https://github.com/drorata/mushrooms-ml).
